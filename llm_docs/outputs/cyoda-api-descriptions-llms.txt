## API Sections

### [CQL Execution Statistics](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/cql-execution-statistics)

Endpoints for monitoring CQL query execution performance and statistics

### [Edge message](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/edge-message)

4 endpoints

### [Entity Management](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/entity-management)

APIs for managing entities including creation, updates, and statistics retrieval.

A note on transaction handling:
* All changes are executed transactionally
* Collections are processed in transactional batches defined by `transactionWindow`
* Collections exceeding `transactionWindow` size are automatically split into multiple transactional batches

A note on transitions:
* Normal transitions are explicitly configured in the workflow and move entities between different states
* Loopback transitions are virtual transitions that loop back to the same state without explicit configuration
* Loopback transitions trigger the first allowable automated exit transition, enabling subsequent automated workflow traversal

### [Entity Model, Workflow](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/entity-model-workflow)

2 endpoints

### [Entity model](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/entity-model)

Operations for managing entity models, including import/export, versioning, and lifecycle management.
Supports model locking/unlocking, change level control, and metadata conversion through various formats.

Model Lifecycle Rules:
- Entity models must be locked before any entities can be saved using that model
- A locked model cannot be unlocked if there are existing entities in the database using that model
- Models can only be deleted when unlocked and when no entities reference them

Change Level Control:
Models support hierarchical change levels (from least to most impactful):
- ARRAY_LENGTH: Only allows UniTypeArray width increases
- ARRAY_ELEMENTS: Permits MultiTypeArray changes without new types
- TYPE: Allows type modifications
- STRUCTURAL: Permits fundamental model changes

When a change level is set, all less impactful changes are automatically allowed.

### [Entity, Audit](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/entity-audit)

1 endpoints

### [OAuth, Keys](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/oauth-keys)

5 endpoints

### [OAuth, OIDC Providers](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/oauth-oidc-providers)

7 endpoints

### [SQL-Schema](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/sql-schema)

Operations for managing SQL schemas and tables

### [Search](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/search)

Provides endpoints for searching and retrieving entities using both synchronous and asynchronous approaches.

Key Features:
- Snapshot-based searches for large datasets
- Real-time synchronous searches for immediate results
- Point-in-time querying capabilities
- Pagination support for large result sets

Search Methods:
1. Snapshot Search (/snapshot/*):
   - Creates a persistent snapshot of search results
   - The query is distributed across the cluster of Cyoda processing nodes
   - Horizontally scalable - query time decreases linearly with cluster size
   - Supports asynchronous processing of large datasets
   - Allows status monitoring and cancellation
   - Results can be retrieved in pages

2. Direct Search (/{entityName}/{modelVersion}):
   - Synchronous, in-memory search
   - Designed for small to medium datasets
   - Limited by maximum result set size (default: 1000, max: 10000)
   - Non-distributed (executes on single node)
   - Configurable timeout and result limits
   - Returns immediate streaming results

All endpoints support:
- Point-in-time queries using ISO 8601 datetime format
- Complex search conditions using GroupConditionDto
- Model-specific searches by entity name and version

### [Stream Data](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/stream-data)

Endpoints for streaming data operations, configuration management, and query planning

### [User, Account](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/user-account)

2 endpoints

### [User, Machine](https://docs.cyoda.net/api-reference/scalar/#description/user-machine)

5 endpoints
