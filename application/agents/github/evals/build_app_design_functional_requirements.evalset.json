We follow a **GitOps practice**, which means the repo isn't just for code\u2014it's the anchor for your entire project. Setting it up now ensures that every design choice and configuration we make next has a permanent home immediately.\n\nSince we're building an institutional trading platform (real-time market data feeds, advanced OMS, portfolio tracking, risk controls, compliance, and real-time P&L), having the repo initialized up front is important so requirements, designs, and incremental code are tracked and reproducible. Once the repo and branch are created from the standard Cyoda template, we can iterate through Design (Canvas) \u2192 Build \u2192 Environment \u2192 Deploy with the repository as the single source of truth.\n\nWhen you choose the language and repository strategy below, I'll initialize the repository using the Cyoda template for that stack and generate the branch for our work.\n\n[options-single-choice: Python \u2014 Public repo \u2014 New Branch, Python \u2014 Public repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Python \u2014 Private repo \u2014 New Branch, Python \u2014 Private repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Java \u2014 Public repo \u2014 New Branch, Java \u2014 Public repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Java \u2014 Private repo \u2014 New Branch, Java \u2014 Private repo \u2014 My Existing Branch]"
