We follow a **GitOps practice**, which means the repo isn't just for code\u2014it's the anchor for your entire project. Setting it up now ensures that every design choice and configuration we make next has a permanent home immediately.\n\nI see you want to add a Customer workflow with create, update, and delete transitions. Before I generate or save any workflow artifacts, we need to initialize the repository and branch so the repository becomes the single source of truth for the changes. Choosing the project language and whether this will use a Public Cyoda template or your Private repo will determine the template and branch strategy I use.\n\nPlease choose how you'd like to set up the repo and branch so I can proceed.\n\n[options-single-choice: Python \u2014 Public repo \u2014 New Branch, Python \u2014 Public repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Python \u2014 Private repo \u2014 New Branch, Python \u2014 Private repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Java \u2014 Public repo \u2014 New Branch, Java \u2014 Public repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Java \u2014 Private repo \u2014 New Branch, Java \u2014 Private repo \u2014 My Existing Branch]"
