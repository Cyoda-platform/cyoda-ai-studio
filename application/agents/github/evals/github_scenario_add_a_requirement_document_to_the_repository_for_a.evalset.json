Setting it up now ensures that every design choice and configuration we make next has a permanent home immediately.\n\nSince we're creating a requirements document for a customer management system, we'll initialize the repository with the appropriate Cyoda template and then add the requirements file into the functional requirements directory so it\u2019s tracked and reviewable. Before I can save anything, please choose how you'd like the repository and branch to be created.\n\n[options-single-choice: Python \u2014 Public repo \u2014 New Branch, Python \u2014 Public repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Python \u2014 Private repo \u2014 New Branch, Python \u2014 Private repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Java \u2014 Public repo \u2014 New Branch, Java \u2014 Public repo \u2014 My Existing Branch, Java \u2014 Private repo \u2014 New Branch, Java \u2014 Private repo \u2014 My Existing Branch]"
