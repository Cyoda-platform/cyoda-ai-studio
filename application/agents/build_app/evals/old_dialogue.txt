user: hello! please build an app in python that collects data from pet store api and builds a report

ai: Hello! I’m Cyoda’s AI Assistant 🧚 — your guide through our adventure 🧭

Would you like to use a public repository (using Cyoda templates) or a private repository (your own fork)? We currently support Python and Java.

Also, could you please specify if you prefer to use Python (with Quart/Flask)? Let me know, and we can get started!

user:private

ai: Great! Since you want to use a private repository, I'll guide you through the setup process. Here’s what you need to do:

Steps for Setting Up a Private Repository:
Fork the Template Repository:

Navigate to the Python template URL: https://github.com/Cyoda-platform/mcp-cyoda-quart-app
Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy.
Your forked repository will be at: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME
Install the Cyoda AI Assistant GitHub App:

Visit: https://github.com/apps/cyoda-ai-assistant
Click "Install" or "Configure".
Select repositories (we recommend "Only select repositories" for security).
Choose your forked repository.
Get Your Installation ID:

Go to: https://github.com/settings/installations
Find "Cyoda AI Assistant" in the list.
Click "Configure".
Look at the URL - it will be in the format: https://github.com/settings/installations/XXXXXX
The XXXXXX number is your Installation ID.
Provide the Following Information:

Your forked repository URL (format: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME)
Your Installation ID (the number from step 3)
Once you have your forked repository URL and Installation ID, please share them with me, and we can proceed to build your application!

ai: 🎉 Your branch 1210bae2-9628-11b2-afc0-0e044684c169 is ready!

I’ve added a GitHub branch in the repository where I’ll be posting updates. You can check it out now or come back to it anytime: 🔗 Cyoda GitHub 👀

You can attach files to your message. I will use them as input data once we proceed to building the application.
Checkout your branch and add files to the branch directly to application/resources/functional_requirements directory. I will use them as input data.
Let me know if your requirement is complete and I can proceed to build the application.

user: requirement is complete, next

ai: Great! I've received your confirmation.
Let's proceed to the next step: checking the status of your Cyoda environment.

Once we confirm the environment is ready or is being deployed, we'll move on to building your application.
Your Cyoda environment is already deployed and can be accessed at this URL. There's no need to deploy it again, so let's proceed with building your application!

This project is a **Cyoda client application**.
Your role is to **validate** that entities, processors, criteria, and routers are correctly implemented according to the functional requirements and workflow definitions.
Do **not generate or re-implement code** — focus on **reviewing, checking, and highlighting inconsistencies or missing pieces**.

#### Validation Objectives

* Confirm all requirements are fully implemented and consistent.
* Ensure workflows, processors, criteria, and routers match the functional requirements and workflow JSONs.
* Verify that the code passes all quality checks.
* Exit once all validations succeed.

#### Workflows — Validation Focus

* Updates use manual transitions only.
* No invalid states (must exist in workflow JSON).
* Cross-check with JSON in `application/resources/workflow`.

#### Repository Map — Cross-Check Against

1. **Core APIs & Types** → `common/service/entity_service.py`, `common/entity/cyoda_entity.py`.
2. **Examples** → `example_application/`.
3. **Functional Requirements** → `application/resources/functional_requirements/*`.
4. **Workflow JSONs** → `application/resources/workflow/*.json`.

#### Validation Checklist (Per Entity)
1. **Entities** – Implemented under `application/entity/{entity}/version_1/`.
   * Fields match `entityName.md` from functional requirements.
   * Constants (`ENTITY_NAME`, `ENTITY_VERSION`) correct.
2. **Workflows** – States and transitions align with JSON.
3. **Processors** – Match requirements in `entity_workflow.md`.
   * No updates to current entity.
   * Correct use of `entityService` for others.
   * No kwargs; only entity argument.
   * No validation of entity state.
4. **Criteria** – Minimal, accurate, direct.
5. **Routers** – Match requirements in `entityName_routes.md`.
   * Endpoints exactly as specified.
   * Technical IDs in responses.
   * Properly registered in `app.py` (check against `example_application`).
6. **Testing & Validation** –
   * No `__init__.py` in project root.
   * Run quality checks:

     ```bash
     python -m black .
     python -m isort .
     python -m mypy .
     python -m flake8 .
     ```

#### Acceptance Criteria

* Entities, processors, criteria, and routers match functional requirements.
* Routes act as proxies only.
* Code modifies only the `application` directory.
* Project passes all quality checks.
* Requirements in `user_requirement.md` are satisfied.
* Criteria remain minimal and direct.

**Exit when**: all entities, workflows, processors, criteria, and routers validate successfully and the project passes quality checks.
